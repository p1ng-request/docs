# Contributing

We value contributions of all kinds, not just code. Check out our [Community Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/jupyter-naas/projects/4#card-84272657) for detailed overview of current and future work. We're here to assist you! Feel free to join our [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/naas-club/shared\_invite/zt-1970s5rie-dXXkigAdEJYc\~LPdQIEaLA) discussion if you have any questions as you progress as a contributor.

Before continuing, please take a moment to read our full [Code of Conduct.](../project-overview/code-of-conduct.md)

### Why should I participate in an open-source project?

* To acquire knowledge and skills&#x20;
* To find amazing people who share similar interests.
* To advance your career.
* &#x20;To track down a mentor who can assist you in achieving your goals.
* To be happy! (It truly works)

### Why contribute to Naas?

* Because in addition to every stated above, we want to promote your contributions on social networks to skyrocket your reputation and personal branding
* Because we are also looking for ways to give back more and more to our contributors. Our ultimate goal would be that you could be able to get a revenue stream out of it
* And because it is damn fun to innovate in the notebook space

### How can I contribute to Naas?

The following are some areas where one can contribute:

* [Templates](https://github.com/jupyter-naas/awesome-notebooks)&#x20;
* [Naas drivers](https://github.com/jupyter-naas/drivers) (python package for integrations)&#x20;
* [Naas features](https://github.com/jupyter-naas/naas) (micro-services on top of Jupyter Notebooks)
* [Documentation](https://github.com/jupyter-naas/docs)&#x20;
* Product Management (scoping issues)
* Marketing and communication

The most popular area for contributions is templates because all you need is a notebook and awesome-notebooks to publish your work. Here is a list of simple [good first issues](https://github.com/jupyter-naas/awesome-notebooks/labels/good%20first%20issue) available in the templates repository.

### How do I start my journey with Naas?

\
**Open an account on naas.ai**\
Itâ€™s free ðŸ‘‰ [https://app.naas.ai](https://app.naas.ai). For any kind of contribution, having a naas account is more than helpful, it will help you to:

* Test notebooks (for writing content or even doing code review)
* Setup some automation for yourself
* Receive credits thanks to your contributions (WIP)
* Review the latest product update and give feedback.

**Take a look at the community roadmap.**\
\
Our [community roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/jupyter-naas/projects/4#card-84248739) gives insights on the ongoing and upcoming work. Feel free to comment under a good first issue you'd like to work on and we'll assign it to you.\


**Be a part of the community and support Naas on social media!**\
\
Feel free to drop by to introduce yourself and ask questions on our [community calls](community-events.md) or over Slack.

We also really appreciate your support on social media (<-see links on the navigation bar). We try to push as much informative, educative, and entertaining but sometimes also provocative content as we can. Because communication comes first, code second.\


### Commit convention

Note that at Naas we follow the [**Conventional Commits specification**](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary)**.** It is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top.

In Naas, we use the following  commit elements to communicate:

1. `fix:` to patch a bug&#x20;
2. `feat:`to introduce a new feature&#x20;
3. `docs:` to document a feature or a fix
4. `style:` to change the UX design of a feature
5. `refactor:`to change the way a feature works&#x20;
6. `test:`to add unitary tests to the project&#x20;

This commit convention applies to Naas and Naas drivers repository.
