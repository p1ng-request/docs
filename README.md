# Get Started

{% hint style="warning" %}
ðŸš€ We are working on a new version of Naas, [apply to our Limited Alpha now](https://bit.ly/3CFSumN)
{% endhint %}

## Welcome to Naas!

Naas (Notebooks as a service) is a low-code open source data & AI platform that empowers anyone working with data (analysts, scientists, and engineers) to create powerful data solutions combining automation, analytics, and AI from the comfort of their Jupyter notebooks.

The platform upgrades notebooks with 3 low-code layers to get things done faster: features, drivers, and templates.

* [**Templates**](templates.md) enable the user to create automated data jobs and reports in minutes.
* [**Drivers**](drivers/) act as connectors to push and/or pull data from databases, APIs, Machine Learning algorithms, and more.
* [**Features**](features/) transform Jupyter in a production-ready environment with scheduling, asset sharing, and notifications.

Our mission is to make data & AI product building accessible to anyone.

## What can you build with Naas?

With Naas platform, you can quickly and easily create a wide variety of data-driven products and applications.

### **Static Reports**

Naas can be used to generate static reports such as PDFs, slides, and spreadsheets. You can create Jupyter notebooks to process and analyze data and then use a library like **`reportlab`** to generate a PDF report. Similarly, you can use **`pandas`** and **`openpyxl`** to generate Excel spreadsheets. Naas provides a simple way to schedule and automate the generation of these reports using the Naas Scheduler.

### **Dynamic Reports and Dashboards**

Naas can be used to create dynamic reports and dashboards using popular open-source libraries such as Plotly Dash, Panel, and Streamlit. You can build interactive web applications that allow users to interact with data and gain insights in real-time. Naas provides a simple way to deploy these applications to the web, so you can share them with your team or customers.

### **APIs**

Naas can be used to build APIs using popular Python frameworks such as FastAPI and Flask. You can create Jupyter notebooks to process and analyze data and then use FastAPI or Flask to create a RESTful API. Naas provides a simple way to deploy these APIs to the cloud, so you can integrate them into your applications.

### **Alerting Systems**

Naas provides a simple way to create alerting systems that notify users via Slack, Teams, WhatsApp, or email. You can use Jupyter notebooks to monitor data and trigger alerts based on specific conditions. Naas provides integrations with popular messaging services, making it easy to send alerts to your team.

### **AI Systems**

Naas can be used to build AI systems such as search and conversational bots that use natural language processing (NLP) to understand and respond to user queries. You can use Jupyter notebooks to train and fine-tune large language models such as OpenAI's GPT-3 on your company's data. Naas provides a simple way to deploy these models to the cloud, so you can integrate them into your applications.

Contact Jeremy on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremyravenel/) or via email [jeremy@naas.ai](mailto:jeremy@naas.ai), if you need guidance in building those solutions for your organization. &#x20;

## Naas Infrastructure

Naas Cloud Infrastructure is the fastest and easiest way to get you started!

Try all of Naas's features for free using [Naas Cloud](https://app.naas.ai/hub/login) a stable environment, without having to install anything.

## Start with templates&#x20;

The easiest way to go is simply to find the right templates for you. Once you have found the templates that suits your needs (if you don't, feel free to [request new templates here](https://github.com/jupyter-naas/awesome-notebooks/issues/new?assignees=\&labels=\&template=template-request.md\&title=Tool+-+Action+of+the+notebook+)), you can start leveraging Naas services to build your solutions. But of course, you can also come with your own notebooks and scripts.

[templates.md](templates.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Naas Services

Naas creates a dynamic production environment for your Notebooks. Each time you run the following formulas in a notebook, it will be sent into the "\_\_production\_\_" folder on your Naas server for execution. &#x20;

To get started, create a folder, open a notebook, and import Naas :

```python
import naas
```

### Schedule Notebooks

Send in production this notebook and run it, every day at 9:00&#x20;

```python
naas.scheduler.add(cron="0 9 * * *")
```

{% content-ref url="features/scheduler.md" %}
[scheduler.md](features/scheduler.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Add Dependencies

Send in production any file type like `test.csv` as a dependency:

```python
naas.dependency.add("test.csv")
```

{% content-ref url="features/dependency.md" %}
[dependency.md](features/dependency.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Add Secret Keys

Copy in production any secret key :

```python
naas.secret.add(name="API_NAME", secret="API_KEY")
```

Remove the previous line and get your secret key with :

```python
naas.secret.get(name="MY_API_KEY")
```

This allows you to push your notebook in production without sensitive data getting exposed.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="features/secret.md" %}
[secret.md](features/secret.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Trigger Webhooks

Copy in production this notebook and allow to run it by calling the returned URL:

```python
naas.webhook.add()
```

Call the URL with your navigator you will get a message and see the notebook has run.

If you want to download the notebook result instead, add this line:&#x20;

```python
naas.webhook.respond_notebook()
```

{% content-ref url="features/api.md" %}
[api.md](features/api.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Expose Assets

Copy in production this asset ( file ) and allow to get it by calling the returned url:

```python
link = naas.asset.add("tesla-chart.html")
```

{% content-ref url="features/asset.md" %}
[asset.md](features/asset.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Send Notifications

Send an email notification to anyone, to notify about data changes, alert on notebooks operations, etc...

```python
# Get link var from previous step
email = "elon@musk.com"
subject = "The tesla action is going up"
content = "check in the link the chart data maide from fresh dataset : " + link
naas.notification.send(email=email, subject=subject, content=content)
```

{% content-ref url="features/notification.md" %}
[notification.md](features/notification.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Create Data Pipelines

Automate and schedule data workflows, streamlining your data processing and saving you time and effort using Notebooks.

Start with this simple dummy pipeline snippet and learn more on the dedicated docs page.&#x20;

```python
from naas.pipeline.pipeline import (Pipeline, DummyStep,End)

pipeline = Pipeline()

step1 = DummyStep("Notebook 1")
step2 = DummyStep("Notebook 2")
step3 = DummyStep("Notebook 3")

pipeline >> step1 >> step2 >> step3 >> End()
pipeline.run()
```

{% content-ref url="features/pipeline-beta.md" %}
[pipeline-beta.md](features/pipeline-beta.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Help & Support&#x20;

### Open help chat

If at any time you are lost, you need help, or just want some info!

```python
import naas

naas.open_help()
```

That will open a chat box with us

### Close help chat

```python
import naas

naas.close_help()
```

### Access documentation

Show a button to quickly open this documentation from Jupyter

```python
import naas
naas.doc()
```
