## Input

### Import libraries


```python
import naas
import requests
import pandas as pd
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from naas_drivers import emailbuilder
from datetime import datetime
import pytz
```

### Setup Draft Kings


```python
# URL to scrap data
URL = "https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/leagues/baseball/88670847"
```

### Setup Naas


```python
# Get all timezone
pytz.all_timezones
```


```python
# Set Time zone
TIME_ZONE = "America/New_York"
naas.set_remote_timezone(TIME_ZONE)
```


```python
# Schedule the Notebook to run at 10 AM each day of the MLB season
naas.scheduler.add(cron="0 10 * 10,11,12,1,2,3,4,5 *")

# To delete your scheduler, uncomment the line below and execute the cell
# naas.scheduler.delete()
```


```python
# Email
EMAIL_TO = "<YOUR EMAIL>"
TODAY = datetime.now(pytz.timezone(TIME_ZONE)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
EMAIL_SUBJECT = f"âš¾ Draft Kings : Your MLB game of the day {TODAY}"
```

## Model

### Scrape Data from Draft Kings


```python
page = requests.get(URL)
soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, "html.parser")
```


```python
results = soup.find(id="root")
```


```python
div = results.find_all("div", class_="parlay-card-10-a")
```

### Separate the Elements


```python
teams = []
lines = []

for element in div:
    team = element.find_all("div", class_="event-cell__name-text")
    teams.append(f"{team}")
    line = element.find_all(
        "span", class_="sportsbook-odds american no-margin default-color"
    )
    lines.append(f"{line}")
```

### Clean Team Element


```python
game_list_1 = []

for t in teams:
    new = t[36:]
    game_list_1.append(new)
```


```python
game_list_2 = []

for g in game_list_1:
    new = g.split(",")
    game_list_2.extend(new)
```


```python
game_list_3 = [
    x.replace(' <div class="event-cell__name-text">', "") for x in game_list_2
]
```


```python
game_list_4 = []

for t in game_list_3:
    new = t[:-6]
    game_list_4.append(new)
```


```python
game_list_5 = [x.replace("<", "") for x in game_list_4]
```


```python
outcomes_today = game_list_5
```


```python
# Change Team Names to Match with 3-letter Code

new1 = [team.replace("ARI Diamondbacks", "ARI") for team in game_list_5]
new2 = [team.replace("ATL Braves", "ATL") for team in new1]
new3 = [team.replace("BAL Orioles", "BAL") for team in new2]
new4 = [team.replace("BOS Red Sox", "BOS") for team in new3]
new5 = [team.replace("CHI Cubs", "CHC") for team in new4]
new6 = [team.replace("CHI White Sox", "CHW") for team in new5]
new7 = [team.replace("CIN Reds", "CIN") for team in new6]
new8 = [team.replace("CLE Guardians", "CLE") for team in new7]
new9 = [team.replace("COL Rockies", "COL") for team in new8]
new10 = [team.replace("DET Tigers", "DET") for team in new9]
new11 = [team.replace("MIA Marlins", "FLA") for team in new10]
new12 = [team.replace("HOU Astros", "HOU") for team in new11]
new13 = [team.replace("KC Royals", "KCR") for team in new12]
new14 = [team.replace("LA Angels", "ANA") for team in new13]
new15 = [team.replace("LA Dodgers", "LAD") for team in new14]
new16 = [team.replace("MIL Brewers", "MIL") for team in new15]
new17 = [team.replace("MIN Twins", "MIN") for team in new16]
new18 = [team.replace("NY Mets", "NYM") for team in new17]
new19 = [team.replace("NY Yankees", "NYY") for team in new18]
new20 = [team.replace("OAK Athletics", "OAK") for team in new19]
new21 = [team.replace("PHI Phillies", "PHI") for team in new20]
new22 = [team.replace("PIT Pirates", "PIT") for team in new21]
new23 = [team.replace("SD Padres", "SDP") for team in new22]
new24 = [team.replace("SF Giants", "SFG") for team in new23]
new25 = [team.replace("SEA Mariners", "SEA") for team in new24]
new26 = [team.replace("STL Cardinals", "STL") for team in new25]
new27 = [team.replace("TB Rays", "TBD") for team in new26]
new28 = [team.replace("TEX Rangers", "TEX") for team in new27]
new29 = [team.replace("TOR Blue Jays", "TOR") for team in new28]
new30 = [team.replace("WAS Nationals", "WAN") for team in new29]
```


```python
teams_today = new30
```

### Clean Lines Element


```python
lines_list_1 = []

for l in lines:
    new = l.split(",")
    lines_list_1.extend(new)
```


```python
lines_list_2 = []

for l in lines_list_1:
    new = l[64:]
    lines_list_2.append(new)
```


```python
lines_list_3 = []

for l in lines_list_2:
    new = l[:-7]
    lines_list_3.append(new)
```


```python
lines_list_4 = [x.replace("<", "") for x in lines_list_3]
```


```python
lines_today = lines_list_4
```

### Check that there is the same number of lines as their is games


```python
correct_num_games = len(lines_today)
```


```python
correct_teams_today = []

if len(teams_today) > len(lines_today):
    correct_teams_today = teams_today[:correct_num_games]
else:
    correct_teams_today = teams_today
```

### Combine the Elements


```python
team1 = teams_today[::2]
team2 = teams_today[1::2]

team1_line = lines_today[::2]
team2_line = lines_today[1::2]

combined_list = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "team1": team2,
        "team2": team1,
        "team1_line": team2_line,
        "team2_line": team1_line,
    }
)

combined_list.drop_duplicates(subset=["team1", "team2"], inplace=True)
```
